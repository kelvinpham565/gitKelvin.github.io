            <p>When junior year comes across my mind, many usually refer to the horrible stigma that junior year is quite the
            daunting and traumatic year for most high school students.  However, I <em>wholeheartedly</em> disagree.  As a motivated and driven junior, 
            I look forward to dealing with such challenges, such as preparing for the SAT, studying for AP tests, and doing my best 
            at club competitions. My goals in life include majoring in STEM and becoming a Sci-Fi novelist. My favorite thing about 
            school is obviously the kind and helpful guidance of Mother Terry Nguyen that students in her class receive every single day.
