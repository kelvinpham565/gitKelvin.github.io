        <h2>Q1: Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h2>
        <h3>A1: Programming concepts I learned in this unit that I applied to my game were the stacked if-else structures and the nested if-else structures. 
        I was struggling at first because I relied on stacked if-else structures.  Even though the code was technically correct, the sprites did not move
        as smoothly as expected.  However, knowing that I could use nested if-else structures, I utilized them to my ability and made my sprites move 
        smoothly.</p>
        <h2>Q2: Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h2>
        <h3>A2: Every time I did a code about scoring, the score box does not show up immediately.  After saving my project, I refreshed my page a couple of times until the box showed up. 
        It was not until I looked back at my code that I realized that the "data" box was not even connected to anything.  This occurred about 5 times. </p>
        <h2>Q3: What aspects of the game do you like the best?</h2>
        <h3>A3: I liked how the game's difficulty increases and how the game over and end screens showed up immediately after a particular action was done.</p>
        <h2>Q4: If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h3>
        <h3>A4: If Ben and I were given more time to work on my game, I would try to add more powerups and levels.  I would add more falling obstacles.</p>
