    <title>About</title>
            <p1>When junior year comes across my mind, many usually think of the horrible stigma that junior year is quite the <br>
            daunting year for most high school students.  However, I <em>wholeheartedly</em> disagree.  As a motivated and driveen junior, <br>
            I am looking forward to taking challenges, such as preparing for the SAT, studying for AP tests, and doing my best <br>
            at club competitions. My goals in life include majoring in STEM and becoming a novelist or a mentor. In my own time,<br>
            I usually listen to the musical soundtracks of Avenue Q and Spring Awakening on loop.  As you can tell, I absolutely <br>
            <em>LOVE</em> musicals and plays.  My favorite thing in school is <em>Academic Decathlon</em> because it's a club full of the best, <br>
            supportive people and advisor I've ever met in my life.  Without Academic Decathlon, I would never learned any <br>
            <em>valuable</em> studying skills and tricks that would help me get A's and B's in my AP classes. </p1>

    <h2><span style="color:white;font-weight:bold"><i>Favorite Quote</i></span></h2>
    <p1>"Life is so full of unpredictable beauty and strange surprises. Sometimes that beauty is too much for me to handle. Do <br>
    you know that feeling? When something is just <em>too beautiful</em>? When someone says something or writes something or plays <br>
    something that moves you to the point of <em>tears</em>, maybe even <em>changes</em> you."</p1>
